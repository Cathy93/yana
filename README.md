**Figure 1**: Client Interaction

The VACL was approached via email to discuss the application idea to help the Aboriginal community with a language mobile leanring tool. A meeting soon followed and the idea was presented to the CEO and he approved the idea to go into an application.

Several weeks were given to produce a minimum viable product (MVP). Throughout the interaction activities, several meetings were held to discuss the application design and to obtain feedbacks. Data used in this application were also provided by VACL.

### Design and Planning Process
#### White Board Brain Storming
Before the start of diving into programming this application, various ideas focusing on design and user experience were taken into consideration. For example, DuoLingo and Babel applications were used as a inspirational ideas to whiteboard some of the features of the application.

#### User Stories
The following were some of the stories used to build the application features.
- In order to learn another language, I want to listen how the word is pronounced.
- In order to learn about Australian Culture, as a Student I want to know some aboriginal words.
- As someone that is learning the aboriginal language, I want to be able to connect with others that are doing the same.
- As student, I want to be able to see the progress I'm making in the course.

#### User Experience (UX) Flow

#### Wireframe Mockup
The wireframe design around the application was accomplished using FIGMA, which is a online collaboration design tool. Most of the mockup was designed based on mobile first philosophy. Design iteration was performed as could be seen in the following figure. The AFTER design sketches were achieved after knowing what sort of required data and the culture significance of the application were identified.
